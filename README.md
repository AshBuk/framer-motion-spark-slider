**Lightweight and fast React slider carousel powered by Framer Motion animations.
Designed as a modern and highly optimized solution for large image datasets, it works seamlessly across laptops, tablets, and phones, with smooth support for both touch and mouse/keyboard input.**

### âœ¦ For businesses and users

A robust slider suitable for galleries, installations, projections, events, or products that need precise, smooth interactions and an accessible UI.

## âœ¦ Features

- Smooth drag-to-swipe with momentum-free, precise control
- Click on center card to select (single tap on touch)
- Auto-play with pause on interaction and hidden tab detection
- Responsive layout using viewport units (`svh`/`svmin`)
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- Accessibility features with ARIA support
- Performance: renders only visible cards, lazy loading for non-center images
- Framework-agnostic: works with Next.js, Vite, Create React App, Remix, Gatsby, and any React framework

### âœ¦ Vercel demo

- Public demo: [spark-slider.vercel.app](https://spark-slider.vercel.app/)
  You are viewing a hosted demo on Vercel. Images are randomized daily via [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos) (sourced from the Unsplash photographers collection). Uploading and managing your own images is disabled here. I am considering expanding the online service with private-cloud storage so users can manage their own images.
  // Private preview (if provided): uploads and deletes are enabled (images up to 5 MB; common image formats).

- The slider uses modern technologies with minimal dependencies (Next.js 15 App Router, React, Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS, CSS viewport units `svh`/`svmin`).
- Performance: renders only visible cards, non-visible slides are not mounted, non-center images use `loading="lazy"`. Scales to large image lists while keeping the DOM small.
