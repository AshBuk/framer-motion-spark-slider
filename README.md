### âœ¦ Screencast

[spark-slider.vercel.app](https://spark-slider.vercel.app/)

**Lightweight and fast React slider carousel powered by Framer Motion animations.
Designed as a modern, custom, and highly optimized solution for large image datasets, it works seamlessly on laptops, tablets, and phones, with smooth support for both touch and mouse/keyboard input.**

### âœ¦ For businesses and users

A robust slider suitable for galleries, installations, projections, events, or products that need precise, smooth interactions and an accessible UI.

## Features

- Smooth drag-to-swipe with momentum-free, precise control
- Click on the center card to enter fullscreen (single tap on touch)
- Auto-play with pause on interaction
- Responsive layout using viewport units (`svh`/`svmin`)
- Simple image uploads UI (Browse/Manage)

### âœ¦ Vercel demo

- Public demo: [spark-slider.vercel.app](https://spark-slider.vercel.app/)
  You are viewing a hosted demo on Vercel. Images are randomized daily via [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos) (sourced from the Unsplash photographers collection). Uploading and managing your own images is disabled here. I am considering expanding the online service with private-cloud storage so users can manage their own images.
  // Private preview (if provided): uploads and deletes are enabled (images up to 5 MB; common image formats).

## For developers

- Packaged as an npm React library for easy reuse in apps (see `packages/spark-slider/README.md`).

**Install as a library**

```bash
npm i @ashbuk/spark-slider framer-motion react react-dom
```

- Stars are appreciated; contributions are welcome! Start onboarding by reading `DEVELOPMENT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Comments in the codebase are concise and serve as additional documentation.

- The project adheres to SOLID and DRY principles.
- The slider uses modern technologies with minimal dependencies (Next.js 15 App Router, React, Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS, CSS viewport units `svh`/`svmin`).
- Performance: renders only visible cards, non-visible slides are not mounted, non-center images use `loading="lazy"`. Scales to large image lists while keeping the DOM small.

Slider breakdown:

- `SparkSlider.tsx` â€” presentation and accessibility: renders position-based cards, handles keyboard and fullscreen.
- `useSparkSlider.ts` â€” interaction/state: index, autoplay, drag/swipe, and transition gating.
- `config.ts` â€” single source of truth (`SLIDER_CONFIG`) for sizes, spacing, positions, spring presets, and thresholds.
